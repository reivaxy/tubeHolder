# tubeHolder


*New* : the openScad file paramTubeBracket.scad allows you to create a bracket for any given number of tubes, and any glass thickness to match your needs ! You can either use it within openScad, or go there : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929873 and click "Open in Customizer"

This is a project to 3D-print a peristaltic pump tube holder.

The source file (.FCStd) was created with FreeCAD, and the .obj file can be used with MakerBot or ReplicatorG to 3D print the holder.
It will allow you to print a bracket to hold 4 tubes on a tank side from 4 to 8 millimiter width



Here is the design:

Here is the first printed item:

And here is the application:

Which is much better than the previous "solution" where all tubes become mostly stuck, and liquids were splashing everywhere:
