# tubeHolder


This is a project to 3D-print a peristaltic pump tube holder for up to 4 tubes on a tank side from 4 to 8 millimiter width.

The source file (.FCStd) was created with FreeCAD, and the .obj file can be used with MakerBot or ReplicatorG to 3D print the holder.

Can be adapted to thicker glass by simply widening the space between the 2 branches.

Warning: This item had not yet been printed, it's a work in progress.
